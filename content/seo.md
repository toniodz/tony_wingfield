Search Optimization is often seen as a dark art, it's not really though and if you consider the following you will be heading in the right direction:

Technology - make sure your website fast & secure. Serve all pages via SSL and sub 1 second page load times.

Relevancy - make sure your content is relevant to the phrase you are trying to rank for. Hyper relevant content leads to success.

Authority - ensure your content is authoritative enough that other websites want to link to it.

Popularity - does your content get viewed - drive traffic to the pages you want to rank from social media.

Simple really ;) If you need help with getting organic traffic please drop me a message.
